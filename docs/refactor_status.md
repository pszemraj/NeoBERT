# Hydra to YAML Refactoring Status

## Completed ✅

### Configuration System
- Successfully refactored from Hydra to simple YAML + argparse system
- Added missing config attributes (GLUEConfig, trainer fields, tokenizer.vocab_size)
- Fixed config loading with proper type conversions (e.g., string lr to float)
- All configuration tests pass

### Model Tests
- Fixed activation function issues (use GELU instead of SwiGLU for CPU testing)
- Added hidden_act parameter to all test configs
- Fixed dropout vs dropout_prob naming
- All model tests pass

### Evaluation Tests  
- Fixed HuggingFace model to convert attention masks to additive format
- Updated all test configs with proper activation functions
- All evaluation tests pass

### Integration Tests
- Fixed optimizer name case sensitivity
- Added missing flash_attention parser argument
- Fixed scheduler parameter naming
- All integration tests pass

### Code Quality
- Applied automatic formatting with isort and ruff
- Fixed unused variable warnings
- Added comprehensive CLAUDE.md documentation

## Issues Requiring Attention ⚠️

### SOAP Optimizer
- Implementation is missing (commented out in optimizer.py)
- Referenced in configs but not available

### Pretraining Pipeline
- Scheduler expects milestones not total steps - needs proper configuration
- Tokenizer vocab size mismatches between configs and actual tokenizers
- Dataset loading works but needs more robust error handling

### XFormers Compatibility
- Version mismatch with flash-attention (requires 2.7.1-2.7.4 but has 2.8.0)
- SwiGLU activation requires specific xformers version
- Flash attention disabled in tests due to compatibility

### Training Pipeline Tests
- Many failures due to missing attributes and configuration mismatches
- Need comprehensive update to match new config structure
- Dataset references (e.g., "wikibook") don't exist

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix scheduler configuration to properly handle warmup/decay milestones
2. **Testing**: Create end-to-end test that runs a few training steps with real data
3. **Documentation**: Update README with new configuration system examples
4. **Compatibility**: Pin xformers and flash-attention versions in requirements
5. **SOAP**: Either implement SOAP optimizer or remove references from documentation

## Test Summary

- ✅ Configuration tests: 10/10 pass
- ✅ Model tests: 16/16 pass  
- ✅ Evaluation tests: 9/9 pass (1 skipped)
- ✅ Integration tests: 8/8 pass
- ❌ Training tests: Multiple failures
- ❌ GPU pretraining: Blocked by scheduler configuration

The refactoring is largely successful for core functionality, but training pipelines need additional work to be fully operational.
