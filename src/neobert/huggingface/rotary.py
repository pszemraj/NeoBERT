"""Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) implementation for NeoBERT.

This module implements Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) as described in RoFormer:
Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864).

RoPE encodes absolute positional information with rotation matrix and naturally
incorporates explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation.

Based on: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/model.py

    """Precompute the frequency tensor for rotary position embeddings.

    This function calculates a frequency tensor with complex exponentials that will
    be used to apply rotary embeddings. The frequencies are computed using the RoPE
    formula with sinusoidal position encoding at different frequency scales.

    Args:
        dim: Dimension of each attention head (must be even).
        end: Maximum sequence length to precompute frequencies for.
        theta: Base value for computing rotation frequencies. Higher values lead to
            lower frequencies, affecting how position information decays with distance.
            Default is 10000.0 as used in the original RoPE paper.

    Returns:
        Complex tensor of shape (end, dim // 2) containing precomputed rotation
        frequencies as complex exponentials.

    Rotary position embeddings encode positional information directly into the
    query and key representations by rotating them in complex space. This allows
    the model to naturally incorporate relative position information in the

    Args:

    Notes:
        - The head dimension must be even for complex number reshaping.
